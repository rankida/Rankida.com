So Git, Heroku, Rails
 - create a new folder for your project
 - git init the folder
 - echo "Rails on Heroku Demo" > README
	- explain what git hub will do on the README file
 - then go to github and create a new repo
 - git add README
 - git commit -m "initial commit"
 - git remote add origin git@github.com:user/new_repo.git
 - git push origin master
 - Go to GitHub and see your readme displayed
-- Heroku
 - heroku create rankida
 - visit the address and see default Heroku site
 - Now our directory is controlled under GitHub and we have a Heroku app we need to link the two
 - First off we need to make a small ruby app so that we can see something on the web. The simplest way is to use sinatra.
require "rubygems"
require "sinatra"

get "/" do
  "<h1>Light the fuse...</h1>"
end
- Call that file app.rb and you will also need a config.rb with this in it:
require 'app'
run Sinatra::Application
- So then you should be able to do "shotgun config.rb -O"
-  So we now have a webpage that shows something. Now lets get it on the web.
 - Need a .gems file!!!! should contain the work sinatra. see http://docs.heroku.com/rack for details.
Wire up the domain name
 - http://docs.heroku.com/custom-domains
 - Firstly need to verify your Heroku account
 - heroku addons:add custom_domains
 - heroku domains:add www.rankida.com - and also rankida.com
 - Go into GoDaddy and choose the domain. Then choose the DNS Manager (not always easy to find).
 - You will need to add the A records for Heroku.
 - Also change the www CNAME to proxy.heroku.com
